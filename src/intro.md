# Welcome!
Welcome to a tutorial about writing front end web applications using Rust.
Roughly I've broken this up into a couple sections:

- [A hard and fast introduction to Rust](./1_rust.md)
- A hard and fast introduction to Rust-to-WASM compilation and using
  [web-sys](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) to write Rust that runs in the
  browser.
- A tour of libraries and frameworks to use that make application development
  generally easier (I hope).

Let's dive in! 🏊🏽
