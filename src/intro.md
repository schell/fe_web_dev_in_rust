# Welcome!
Welcome to a tutorial about writing front end web applications using Rust.
Roughly I've broken this up into a couple sections:

- [A hard and fast introduction to Rust](./1_rust.md)
- [A hard and fast introduction to Rust-to-WASM](./2_browser.md) compilation and
  using [web-sys](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) to write Rust that runs in the
  browser.
- [A tour of a few libraries and frameworks](./3_frameworks.md) to use that make
  application development generally easier (I hope).

This guide is being hosted at [zyghost.com]. I occasionally
write things and put them there.

If you'd like to make a contribution you can edit this guide at its [github repo]
and submit a pull request. :)

Let's dive in! 🏊🏽
