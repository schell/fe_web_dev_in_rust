# Rust's Features

- a strong, static typing discipline, similar to Haskell but still very different
  from Haskell's Hindley-Milner based inference.
- imperative or functional style, a bit like Scala or Swift.
- [eager evaluation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation) of
  expressions.
- type variables and [traits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)
  (which are a bit like interfaces)
- a new, novel concept called a "borrow checker", which obviates garbage
  collection
