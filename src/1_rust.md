# A Lightspeed Introduction to Rust
![rust logo](https://www.rust-lang.org/static/images/rust-logo-blk.svg)

Rust is a programming language.

As of this writing it's at version 1.40, only ~9 years old!

[Rust 1.0 was released in 2015](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/15/Rust-1.0.html)

Compare that to
- JavaScript, 1995 ~24 years old
- Haskell, 1990 ~30 years old

[Mozilla was the first investor in Rust](https://research.mozilla.org/rust/),
being heavily involved in the development of the language.
Coincedentally Mozilla was also heavily involved in the development of JavaScript
(not just) through its beginnings as an arm of the
[Netscape Communications Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape).

People who write Rust are endearingly called "Rustaceans".

[Rust has a (unofficial) mascot named Ferris.](https://www.rustacean.net/)
