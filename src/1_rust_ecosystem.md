# Ecosystem

Rust has a very helpful and friendly community as well as a thriving, though a
bit fledgling ecosystem, backed by the
[cargo package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). Packages (libraries)
are colloquially called "crates". Crates are uploaded to the
[crates.io](https://crates.io/) package repository where they are hosted over
HTTP, along with documentation.

> Hint:
> If you use [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as your search engine you can
> search for crates using bang syntax like `!crates mogwai`, which will warp you
> straight to search results for that crate on crates.io (in this case that's the
> `mogwai` crate).

You can find help at the [rust sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/), the
freenode IRC `##rust` channel or [more](https://www.rust-lang.org/community).

Ok, enough - what does Rust look like?
