# Benchmarks

Using the canonical TodoMVC for most of these libraries (and more) you can bench
their performance with regard to DOM updates.
[Try it yourself here](http://schell.github.io/mogwai/todomvc/perf/). Here are
the results I got:

I believe `mogwai` is fastest here specifically because of the lack of vdom. In
my opinion it hits a good power-to-weight ratio and achieves its goals. I'm
biased though because I wrote it, lol ðŸ˜Š.
